  # Running pre-commit in CI. See semgrep/.pre-commit-config.yaml for

  # Dogfood: note that we run Semgrep inside pre-commit, so this is also dogfooding
  # and testing how semgrep interact with pre-commit.

      # note that in a CI context pre-commit runs the hooks with the '--all' flag, so
      # semgrep for example is passed all the files in the repository, not just
      # the one modifed in the PR (as it is the case when it's ran from git hooks locally).
      # This is why sometimes pre-commit passes locally but fails in CI, for the same PR.
